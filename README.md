# Description

The Weather Dashboard App is a web application that allows users to check the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a specific city. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and presents it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: View the current weather conditions for a selected city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representation of weather conditions.

- **5-Day Forecast**: Get a 5-day weather forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day.

- **Search History**: The app keeps a history of searched cities, allowing users to quickly access weather information for previously searched locations.

3. The app will display the current weather data and the 5-day forecast in the respective sections of the page.
